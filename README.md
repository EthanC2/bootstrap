# Bootstrap
*Bootstrap* is a collection on scripts for automatically installing all of my common defaults for Debian-based
Linux systems. It installs and configures the network, firewall, shell, editors, aliases, and more. To run,
execute `sudo -E ./bootstrap.sh run`. To perform a dry run, use `dryrun` isntead of `run`.
